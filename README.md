Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation:

A program in C which solves the Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation in one dimension for an electron in a harmonic oscillator. The program works using Runge-Kutta combined with an iterative 'Shooting Method' process to converge on the correct energy values, and corresponding wavefunctions, for a user-defined number of energy levels.
